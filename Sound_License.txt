CREATIVE END USER LICENSE/RELEASE:I herein give permission to use my SnowSong Sound Pack free of charge, free of notoriety, free of referencing, entirely free, for personal enjoyment, modification of the Minecraft gaming experience, and most importantly, for Foley and specialized usage in your OWN MODS, resource packs, and your own GAMES if you are a game designer; INDIE or otherwise. This resource pack is a wealth of brilliant FX and music that can and should add professional quality and all-original sound engineering to your audio projects of all sorts. Though a mention or referral to me as sound/music engineer/composer would be nice, it is not in the least bit necessary. Let my work contribute to your endeavors if they would benefit you at any degree of use.

Disclaimer: Uncertainty comes from the fact that it seems like every place I've seen it at has a different license listed.

Planet MineCraft and the downloaded zip file both have The above, CREATIVE END USER LICENSE/RELEASE notice
Minetest Forum says it's CC-BY-SA 4.0
and CurseForge says Apache License Version 2.0

I will use the CC-BY-SA 4.0 license since Sn0wShepherd's own forum topic says that.
